This is the online compiled version hosted on Github Pages:

**http://gaearon.github.io/flux-react-router-example**

To build it, I run this command in the project root:

```
./node_modules/.bin/webpack --config ./webpack.config.production.js
```

It uses hash instead of pushstate so Github Page relative URL works.

If you want to run example locally, git clone it and run it instead:

```javascript
npm install
npm start
```
